# Solidity Portfolio  

This repository contains a collection of my Solidity smart contract projects.  
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my skills as a blockchain developer and demonstrate practical examples of smart contract development.  

##  Projects Included
- **FunctionsExampleProExtended** â€“ Example contract with variables, mappings, arrays and simple logic in Solidity.  
- More projects will be added soon (ERC20, ERC721, DeFi examples, etc.).  

##  Tools & Tech
- Solidity
- Hardhat / Remix IDE
- Git & GitHub  

##  About Me
I am learning and building blockchain applications with a focus on Solidity smart contracts.  
This portfolio will continue to grow as I add more projects.
