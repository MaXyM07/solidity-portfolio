### 1. SimpleStorage.sol
A basic contract that allows storing and retrieving a single unsigned integer value.
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedValue;

    function set(uint256 _value) public {
        storedValue = _value;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedValue;
    }
}
